        comment: "After investigation, the error appears to be related to the Wouter router library. The error 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')' is likely due to an issue with the router configuration in App.tsx. The application is using the Wouter router library, and there might be an issue with how routes are being matched or configured."
