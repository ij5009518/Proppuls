        comment: "Verified that the 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')' error is gone. The application loads properly without JavaScript errors. The Unit Details Dialog is implemented in the Units.tsx file as part of the View Unit Dialog component. The dialog has the correct size (max-w-3xl), all 4 tabs (Details, Tenant, Maintenance, Photos), compact layout in Details tab, Edit Status button in Tenant tab, combined Maintenance & Tasks in Maintenance tab, and Upload Photos functionality in Photos tab. The blue color scheme is consistent throughout the dialog."
