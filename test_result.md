    message: "I've tested the billing system functionality and found that all the billing-related endpoints are implemented but are failing due to a database configuration mismatch. The server is configured to use PostgreSQL (requires DATABASE_URL environment variable) but the current setup is using MongoDB. This is causing all billing-related operations to fail. The code implementation looks correct, but the database connection issue needs to be resolved before the billing system can function properly."
